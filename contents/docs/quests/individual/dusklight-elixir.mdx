## Quest Description

Elder Mirae hands you an ancient parchment, its edges yellowed with age and covered in precise alchemical notation.

"**The recipe for Dusklight Elixir. Named for its power to transform darkness into light, corruption into blessing**," she explains. "**This formula was used in the old days when such blights were more common.**"

She nods toward the alchemical apparatus set beneath the Heart Grove's protective canopy. "**The elixir must be brewed here, under the tree's blessing. The sacred energies will help stabilize the transmutation of the tainted sap into something beneficial.**"

"**Work carefully. This alchemy is older than the village itself.**"

## Objectives

- Brew 1 Dusklight Elixir
- Return to Elder Mirae at the Heart Grove

## Rewards

Upon completion, you will receive:

- 500 Alchemy XP
- 500 Reputation XP
