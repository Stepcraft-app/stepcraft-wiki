## Quest Description

Elder Mirae's face grows grave as she examines the tainted samples, her ancient fingers tracing patterns in the air above them.

"I have seen this corruption before, though **not in my lifetime**," she murmurs, her voice heavy with concern. "**The old texts speak of such darkness. A blight that spreads through the very essence of living things.**"

She gestures toward the sacred spring that feeds the Heart Grove, its waters shimmering with an inner light. "**But there is hope. The pure waters of our blessed spring hold cleansing properties beyond measure. Gather what flows from the source itself. Ten measures should suffice.**"

"Return to me when you have the water, and I shall teach you to brew something that can turn this corruption into strength."

## Objectives

- Gather 10 Pure Water from the Spring
- Find Elder Mirae at the Heart Grove

- 500 Foraging XP
