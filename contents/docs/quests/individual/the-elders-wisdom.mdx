## Quest Description

Elder Mirae traces the ancient words on the moonstone tablet with trembling fingers.

**"Eight hundred years... I've been counting the years wrong. I thought we had more time."**

She looks at you with new intensity. **"This prophecy - your parents were searching for something like this. They believed the old warnings were more than legend."**

She glances toward the Heart Grove, its light flickering weakly in the morning sun. **"The Devourer stirs, feeding on our land's strength from below. But rushing to the other regions unprepared would be foolish."**

You need to become someone capable of uniting peoples who have forgotten they ever stood together. Learn every craft Willow's Reach can teach. Help every soul who needs you. Understand what we're fighting to save.

Only when you've grown strong in body, mind, and purpose should you attempt the **Sunforge Sands**. The journey ahead will test everything you are.
