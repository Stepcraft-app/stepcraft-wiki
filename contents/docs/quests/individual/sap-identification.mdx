## Quest Description

If anyone can identify this corruption, it would be **Elder Mirae**.

Her knowledge of the old ways runs deeper than the roots of the Heart Grove itself. Surely she's encountered something like this in her centuries of study, or at least heard tales from the ancient texts.

The sooner you reach her, the sooner you might understand what threatens Silverleaf Refuge.

## Objectives

- Find Elder Mirae at the Heart Grove

## Rewards

Upon completion, you will receive:

- 500 Foraging XP
- 500 Reputation XP

## Quest Chain

**Next Quest:** [The Elder's Remedy](/docs/quests/individual/the-elders-remedy)
