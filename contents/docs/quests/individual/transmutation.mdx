## Quest Description

The completed Dusklight Elixir swirls with an otherworldly luminescence, the dark corruption of the tainted sap now transformed into something that pulses with protective power.

Elder Mirae nods approvingly as she examines your work. "**Perfect. You have successfully transmuted corruption into blessing. A skill few master.**"

"**This elixir holds the power to enhance weapons beyond their natural limits, imbuing them with the cleansing force of the Heart Grove itself. Keep it safe, young one. When you find a blade worthy of such enhancement, return to me and I shall teach you the final ritual.**"

"**You have done well today. The threat to Silverleaf Refuge has become a gift of power.**"
