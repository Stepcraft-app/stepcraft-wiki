## Quest Description

Elder Mirae greets you at dawn beneath the Heart Grove's ancient boughs.

**"Your Giving Days begin with the most essential task - feeding our people."**

The festival feast needs fresh Salmowiches this year. Journey to **Blooming Glade** for wheat - once you reach level 2 in farming, you'll master the milling arts to turn it into flour. Then head to **Crystalrun River** where the salmon are abundant.

Gather what you need, then return to me.

_Oh, and leave the Heart Grove's pond untouched - those fish are sacred._

## Objectives

- Harvest 24 Wheat in Blooming Glade
- Mill 12 Flour in Blooming Glade
- Catch 12 Salmon at Crystalrun River
- Return to Elder Mirae at the Heart Grove

## Rewards

Upon completion, you will receive:

- 150 Agility XP
- 250 Farming XP
- 250 Fishing XP
- 250 Reputation XP
- 100 Gold
