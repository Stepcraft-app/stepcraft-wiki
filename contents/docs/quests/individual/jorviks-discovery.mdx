## Quest Description

Jorvik's calloused hands shake slightly as he unhitches his weary oxen from the cart.

**"Glad you came over, friend. Been thinking about this the whole journey back,"** he says, glancing around to ensure no one else is listening. **"Something's not right at Silverleaf Refuge. Been cutting timber there for decades, but this time... the trees are bleeding."**

He pulls a silverleaf from his satchel, its normally pristine surface stained with something dark and viscous. **"Black sap, thick as honey but wrong somehow. Never seen anything like it. The trees look healthy enough, but this substance... it makes my skin crawl."**

**"Would you mind taking a look? Fresh eyes might spot something I missed."**
