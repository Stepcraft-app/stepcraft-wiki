## Quest Description

With your basket full of wheat and fresh-caught salmon, you make your way to **Willowbend Plaza**.

The festival ovens are already warm, their smoke mixing with the morning mist. Elder Mirae's instructions echo in your mind - **the village depends on everyone doing their part, especially this year.**
