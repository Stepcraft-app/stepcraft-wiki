## Quest Description

Among the slime's remains, you discover what caught young Pyria's eye - an ancient tablet carved from moonstone, its surface still reflecting light after centuries in darkness.

The elvish script is old, predating even the village records:

**"Eight hundred years shall pass in peace, while the Devourer sleeps beneath. When the Heart Grove's bounty fades and fails, when dwarven forges cool their nails, when human towers crumble down, and orcish drums make no more sound - then does the Devourer wake, all lands and life it seeks to take. Apart we fall, together stand, unite once more to save the land."**

Your hands tremble as you realize this prophecy is coming true - the failing harvests are just the beginning.

## Objectives

- Bring the Moonstone Tablet to Elder Mirae at the Heart Grove

## Rewards

Upon completion, you will receive:

- 250 Agility XP
- 500 Reputation XP
- 500 Gold
