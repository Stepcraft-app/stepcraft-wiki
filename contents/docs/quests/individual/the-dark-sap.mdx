## Quest Description

The ancient silverleaf trees stand as they always have, their silver-white bark catching the dappled sunlight. But Jorvik was right. Something is deeply wrong here.

Dark rivulets of sap weep from the bark like tears, pooling in the crevices and staining the fallen leaves below with an oily sheen. The substance has an almost metallic smell that makes your nose wrinkle.

The corruption seems concentrated around the fallen leaves scattered at the base of each tree. You'll need to collect samples of both the leaves and the strange sap if you hope to understand what's happening to this sacred refuge.

## Objectives

- Collect 10 Silverleaf Leaves
- Collect 10 Tainted Sap

## Rewards

Upon completion, you will receive:

- 500 Foraging XP
- 500 Reputation XP
