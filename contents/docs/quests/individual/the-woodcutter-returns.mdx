## Quest Description

The familiar sound of heavy boots on cobblestone draws your attention as you pass through the village square. **Jorvik** the woodcutter has returned from his weekly timber run, his oxen snorting wearily as they pull his cart into the plaza.

The cart sits notably lighter than usual, and something in Jorvik's expression catches your eye. A troubled furrow marks his weathered brow that wasn't there when he left. The other villagers seem too busy with their daily routines to notice, but you've always been observant.

Perhaps a friendly greeting is in order.

- 250 Agility XP
- 250 Reputation XP
