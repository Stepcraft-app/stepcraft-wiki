## What Kind of Contributions Do We Need?

## Writing Guidelines

### Content Style
- **Be clear and concise** - explain things simply
- **Stay accurate** - base information on current game version
- **Be helpful** - think about what players need to know
- **Link related content** - connect pages together

### Formatting Tips
Every page should start with this structure:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Page Title"
description: "Brief description for search results"
---

# Your Page Title

Your content here...

## Main Sections
Use ## for major sections

### Subsections  
Use ### for smaller sections
```

### Using Tables
Great for stats, recipes, and structured data:

```markdown
| Item | Level | Damage |
|------|-------|--------|
| Iron Sword | 10 | 25 |
| Steel Sword | 20 | 45 |
```

### Adding Links
Link to other wiki pages:
```markdown
[Iron Ore](/docs/resources/individual/iron_ore)
[Mining Skill](/docs/skills/individual/mining)
```

## Mark Pages as Verified (lastVerified)

We now support a verification badge to indicate that a page has been recently reviewed by a human contributor.

### What it does
- When you add `lastVerified` to the page frontmatter, a checkmark icon appears next to the page title.
- Hovering the icon shows a tooltip like ‚ÄúVerified on YYYY-MM-DD‚Äù.

### When to use it
- After you have reviewed the page for accuracy against the current game version or patch.
- After updating content that was previously outdated or incomplete.

### Recommended format
- Use ISO date format: `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2025-08-10`).

### How to add it
Add `lastVerified` to the frontmatter at the top of the file:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Page Title"
description: "Brief description for search results"
keywords: [tag1, tag2]
lastVerified: 2025-08-10
---
```

That‚Äôs it ‚Äî the page will display a green check icon next to the title.
